<h3>[Verse 1: JoshDub]</h3>

<p>
    Ayy, it's DubDaddy on the track
    Not a rapper, but I thought I'd have a crack
    Another song, another bar, another stack
    We keep coming back, now we picking up a slack
    Get laid, get paid, get a raid
    Trigger-Treat sweet, but can't beat the blade
    It's Halloween bitch, it's time to get made
    Better lock up, or you're gonna get slayed
    Ayy, The Boys are coming in
    Got lit last night, on the Cherry Gin
    Smoking gas, eating ass, not commiting sin
    We're going large like Amy Schumer's second chin
    Hey everybody, my name is JoshDub
    When I don't do crime, I talk shit at the club
    I like Corona, no lime, and having a tug
    I get my bread, no crust, cause you know I'm a thug
</p>

<h3>[Verse 2: Mully]</h3>

<p>
    It's Halloween, my girl cooking clean
    Doing flips in the sheets, call that trick-n-treat
    In the back of a Bentley and we got on rings
    Riding in the streets, shouting scary things
    (Boo! Ahh!)
    The Boys in town and we hunting clowns
    Couple kings with a couple crowns (bank mate)
    Scaring kids while we're blowing clouds
    It's Mully in the back and
    Your bitch is getting plowed
</p>

<h3>[Verse 3: Narrator]</h3>

<p>
    It's spooky and cold on this dreadful night
    But we got some beauties in our sight
    We love the shadows, and fear the light
    But we'll steal your girl with one quick bite
    On Halloween, you can hear many sounds
    Some screaming, some crying in the background
    But if I see some kind of creepy clown
    Oh, you better believe it's going down
    All the witches they be on me, with glee
    When I walk up in the room it's a party
    Got no reflection but there's one thing you can see
    Our competition running scared as they should be
    Never giving out our secrets so like (hush, hush, hush)
    Wiping away all the haters like a (brush, brush, brush)
    We be stealing all your candy in a (rush, rush, rush)
    Dropping songs and videos that always (crush, crush, crush)
</p>

<h3>[Chorus: The Boys]</h3>

<p>
    Got these demons in my head overwhelming me with fear and dread (dread, dread, dread)
    Screaming in my bed, keep me grinding till' I'm dead (dead, dead, dead)
    Spirits in my mind come and visit me from time to time (time to time, time, time)
    People say I'm sick but I swear to God I'm fine (I'm fine, I'm fine)
</p>

<h3>[Verse 4: EddieVR]</h3>
<p>
    Trick or Treat, excuse me, what the fuck is this?
    Candy corn, Bit-O-Honey, one Hershey Kiss?
    ¿Que no sabes que me dicen "El Mexorcist"?
    If you don't know who I am then I'll tell you what it is
    Got a blanket to protect me, and a wooden cross
    I sprinkle holy water to show demons who's boss
    I make videos to scare all the kiddos
    And I'll exorcise your Tía with a bag of hot Cheetos
    I shook Freddy Krueger's hand
    Graw harder than the Grudge
    Make Pennywise float too two and give Huggy Wuggy a hug
    I got good at hide and seek, you can always ask the Fed
    I put poison in your goat, now that Chupa Cabra's dead
    I live in the States, born in Monterrey
    Got a gringa by my side, she can cook some frijoles
    I crossed the border and la migra said "Hey"
    "Come on down, but you just can't stay"Running and hiding and working and fighting
    You don't got the papers to even be trying
    To say it was easy, then I would be lying
    Soy un imigrante con gran corazón
    En vez de rocogiendo la basura de tu escaloña
    Ahora ocupo la pantalla de tu habitación
    Hasta parece que yo tomo gasolina
    Te incendio con mi rap, es los pura adrenalina
    Mi tierra, la exraño, nunca olvidare mi casa
    ¡Un saludo para todos mis Latinos y mi raza!
    Now give me the Reese's Cup, bitch!
</p>
<h3>[Verse 5: Juicy]</h3>
<p>
    Ya-da, ya-da, ya-da, ya-da
    Something 'bout a square
    You, me, and Juice Box 'bout to go blare (blair)
    Like the witch, that's a sitch
    Halloween night, 'bout to wake up in a ditch
    And I'm stacking up dinero
    Got this young man feeling like George Romero
    Picked up on clean know we saw it in the taro's
    Dig a little deeper, boy, you almost at the mid-row
</p>

<h3>[Verse 6/Outro: Juicy]</h3>

<p>
    I don't really know
    I don't really know
    Ya-da, ya-da
    Ya-da, ya-da
    My goldfish took a little holiday
    Left me feeling sour like that Minute Maid
    One day he said he wanna go to outer space
    So I made a little rocket out of Gatorade bottles
    Caught your grandma at the Wal-Mart
    And she gonna catch the fade
    I don't really give a fuck
    I'm just tryna get paid
    I will smoke your grandad too if he even looks my way
    I will kick your little sister in her motherfucking face
    That's that shit you learn in Florida when you smoking K-2
    Hold that shit up in my chest, boy, I'm bout to turn blue
    I might mosey down to Target, man, and buy me that canoe
    I can't- haha.. uh
